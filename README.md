# Book Search Engine

This project implements a book recommendation system using various data structures and search algorithms to optimize query efficiency. The system allows users to search for books based on different criteria, such as title, author, genre, average rating, number of pages, number of reviews, publication date, and publisher. Additionally, it provides recommendations based on specific categories.  

## Features  

- Searches books using multiple criteria.  
- Retrieves the top 5 most relevant books in a category.  
- Implements different data structures to optimize performance.  
- Compares search and data storage algorithms.
